# Dropdown Project Comparison

This project compares two dropdown implementations: one using Sass and the other using Material-UI (MUI). We looked at bundle sizes, development time, code quality, learning experience, and fun factor.

## Running the Projects

To run each project, go to the project folder and start the development server:

For example:
```bash
cd mui-dropdown
npm run dev
```

and
```bash
cd sass-dropdown
npm run dev
```

## Detailed Comparison

### Sass Implementation

- **Bundle Size**: 
  - Client: 997 KB 
  - NodeJS: 713 KB
- **Development Time**: 2 hours
- **Code Quality**: Pretty good, but a bit more effort to manage state and styles.
- **Learning Experience**: Good for understanding state management and CSS modules.
- **Fun Factor**: Not as fun, more manual work needed.

### MUI Implementation

- **Bundle Size**: 
  - Client: 1.56 MB 
  - NodeJS: 1.28 MB
- **Development Time**: 30 minutes
- **Code Quality**: Very clean and easy to read.
- **Learning Experience**: Great for learning Material-UI and best practices.
- **Fun Factor**: More fun, easier to manage UI states with Material-UI.

## Conclusion

Both implementations have their pros and cons. The Sass version gives you more control and learning opportunities, while the Material-UI version is quicker to develop and more enjoyable to work with.
